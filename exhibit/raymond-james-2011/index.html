<p><strong>Exhibit 88:</strong></p>
<p>From JRT to JS. 1/21/16 5:59 PM
Hey just spoke with RJ. They pushed valuation real hard but the feeling is
everyone is comfortable at 17-18x ($340-360mm). Very solid given where we
started. Lighthouse on Monday.</p>
<p>From JS to JRT 1/21/16 6:13 PM
Good work.</p>
<p>From JS to JRT 1/21/169:22PM
Where r we on search?</p>
<p>From JRT to JS. 1/21/16 9:23 PM
2nd round on wed</p>
<p>From JRT to JS 1/21/16 9:23 PM
Falfurrias next Monday</p>
<p>From JRT to JS 1/21/16 9:23 PM
Lighthouse Monday</p>
<p>From JRT to JS 1/21/16 9:24 PM
Then TA/vista/Welsh</p>
<p>From JRT to JS 1/21/16 9:24 PM
U around next week?</p>
<p>From JS to JRT 1/21/169:25 PM
On way back to Vegas but I
can fly anywhere any day</p>
<p>From JRT to JS 1/21/16 9:24 PM
Let's do falfurrias Monday
Then lighthouse in Philly?</p>
<p>From JS to JRT 1/21/16 9:28PM</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>From JRT to JS; 1/22/16 7:15 AM
Spoke with RJ last night, Lighthouse
on Monday in afternoon 3pm in
Philly.</p>
<p>From JS to JRT 1/22/16 7:35 AM
Ok. What about falfurrias?</p>
<p>From JRT to JS; 1/22/16 8:01 AM
Monday at 9am in NY
I can go up Sunday night if you want?</p>
<p>From JS to JRT 1/22/16 8:03 AM
Sounds good.</p>
<p>From JRT to JS 1/22/16 8:05 AM
Ok.</p>
<p>From JRT to JS: 1/25/16: 8:47 AM
How was falfurrias?</p>
<p>From JS to JRT I/25/169:59 AM
It went well. They seemed
genuinely interested, particularly
with the recurring revenue model.
They also liked the fact we built
vs bought our technology and
discussed us acquiring other
companies after they invest. They
went thru their diligence and
investment process. We will hear
from then in a week or so if
they want to move forward.
It was 2 partners and 2 analysts.
How's lighthouse?</p>
<p>From JRT to JS, 1/25/16, 10:50 AM
I think pretty good. I really feel
like they like s4. They
obviously know the rev/costs.
We gave them a 90 p
page
deck. I spoke with [Redacted] after</p>
<p>From JRT to JS, 1/25/16, 10:55 AM
And they know our multiple is too
low. I told him we r going to get
20+. He didn't flinch.</p>
<p>From JRT to JS 1/25/16 11:05 AM</p>
<p>RJ is working on this 24/7.
Spoke with both
[Redacted] and [Redacted]
last night.
From JS to JRT, 1/25/16, 11:31 AM
Great.</p>
<p>From JS to JRT, 2/17/16, 8:29 PM</p>
<p>RJ called. Wants to push to get
lighthouse done at $400-$420. Thoughts?</p>
<p>From JRT to JS, 2/17/16, 8:41 PM
I guess we have to see everything
that is included.
We never had the ta vista and
Welsh meetings yet?</p>
<p>From JRT to JS, 2/17/16, 8:48 PM
Also, what r they saying about the
process? Are they saying we will get
a term sheet?</p>
<p>From JS to JRT. 2/17/16, 9:09 PM
Havent had meetings yet
RJ said tied up with earnings
release. He is saying they want
to move extremely fast and will
get term sheet.</p>
<p>From JS to JRT 2/17/169:14 PM
He also wants to get it done
before first quarter earnings
because the value only increases
from here
I told him that was fine but first
quarter is almost over</p>
<p>From JRT to JS. 2/17/16, 9:23 PM
Yeah. I hear you. It's a pretty big
move up and I trust RJ</p>
<p>From JS to JRT; 2/17/16,9:24 PM
I'm pretty sure they will shut us
down</p>
<p>From JRT to JS 2/17/16 10:16 PM
Sure.
From JRT to JS 2/18/16 7:32AM
What do u want to do today?
You want me to go to RJ?</p>
<p>From JRT to JS 2/18/16 7:45 AM
It's really just about setting up the
calls. We can get term sheet first.</p>
<p>From JS to JRT; 2/18/16 7:51 AM
Ok
From JRT to JS, 2/18/16; 7:53 AM
I will get going now..</p>
<p>From JS to JRT, 2/18/16, 7:54 AM
Thx
From JRT to JS, 2/18/16, 8:33 AM
Just tried him now.</p>
<p>From JRT to JS, 2/22/16 7:12 PM.
What r u thinking?
From JS to JRT 2/22/16 7:56 PM
I think lighthouse could be a
good fit and if we can get close on
price it will be great. The fact
they do terminals too is a bonus
and we both may be able to leam
from each other. The fact they
are public is a good and bad
thing. Public companies tend
to treat their step children
differently but it may make it
easier for us to raise money to
buy others, so it may make it
easier to grow. Im also a little
nervous that we are only talking
to them because they haven't
moved as fast as I thought they
would. I expected a term sheet
or at least a draft of one by
now. We could have pushed
harder with TA and falfurrias
too, and Welsh is in next week.
So....I'm good with either way
right now. I'm anxious to travel
this week to see what is out
there at Welsh.
From JRT to JS 2/22/168:46PM
Ok. Keep me in the loop.

everyone is comfortable at 17-18x ($340-$360mm). Very solid given where we
started. Lighthouse on Monday.</p>

<p>This looks very good and is a great starting point. A couple thoughts.</p>
<ol>
<li>The purchase price now assumes our 16' rev is 22.8. I'm good with it
but we should probably get comfortable with it.</li>
<li>The mgmt comp plan isn't clear. It just says 350k salary. This
should really be 550k for myself 350k for randy and the 600k to
other key execs which totals the 1.5. At a minimum, it should
say my comp is separate from this plan to avoid issues later.
Also, if we do over 24mm in year one which I think is highly
likely, is there a kicker?</li>
<li>It doesn't say we are going to be running our company. The SHIFT4
Board section assumes it's us running it which is good but the
comp plan should mention it.</li>
<li>I think 36 months is too long for both the earn out and lockup.
The s4 team is going to have a lot of net worth tied up
in this deal so they should have a chance to get liquid before
then. I think the longest should be 2 years and the shortest can
be 12-18 months. I'm open to suggestions here.</li>
<li>The 20mm line should be 25mm and say for general use for things
like acquisitions.</li>
<li>The earn out plan should be tied to ebitda as well. The 7mm net
rev target is easy to calculate. The s4 team needs .</li>
