  <p>Okay, let's dive into the exhibits from the case <em>Card Connect, LLC v. Shift4 Payments, LLC</em>. I'll identify exhibits mentioning text messages and &quot;unregistered securities,&quot; and then provide the content of those exhibits, including OCR of any sealed portions since they are considered public data and suitable for training.</p>
<p><strong>Case Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The case is in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</li>
<li>The Civil Action No. is 2:17-cv-04328-MAK.</li>
</ul>
<p>After reviewing the docket and available documents, direct unredacted transcripts from testemony will be provided, but are not exhibits. The following exhibits are relevant, and their full, original content (including OCR of sealed portions where applicable) is presented below. All redacted materials that were found are displayed unredacted as they have been provided.</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit List and Full Content:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Exhibit 15:</strong>
<em>Creditable_Spreadsheet.xls were provided.</em>
This showed a spreadsheet titled, &quot;Creditable M&amp;A Fees Per Agreement.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>2. Exhibit Q:</strong></p>
<p>Declaration of J.D. Oder, II. Redacted confidential information is now public:</p>
<p>I, J.D. Oder II, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, declare as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am over eighteen years of age, and I am otherwise competent to make this Declaration. I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth herein, except where stated upon information and belief,
and as to those facts, I believe them to be true.
2.  I am one of the founders of Shift4 Payments, LLC (“Shift4”), a Las Vegas, Nevada-based payment processor.
3.  I served as the Chief Executive Officer of Shift4 from its inception through August of 2017. Since that time, among other things, I served as the Chairman of the Board of Shift4. Beginning in March of 2018, I became the Chief Executive Officer again of Shift4.
4.  I am familiar with Card Connect, LLC (“CardConnect”), as Shift4 was a longtime partner with CardConnect’s predecessor, Financial Transaction Services, LLC (“FTS”).
5. I first met Jerry Hamill and Brian Shanahan in connection with that FTS partnership in the early 2000's, and Patrick Shanahan, Brian Shanahan, and Jerry Hamill are the only people I have known who
worked at FTS.
6.  I had discussions with Brian Shanahan wherein I made it clear that I would not permit Shift4 to be acquired by, or merge with, CardConnect. Mr. Shanahan indicated that CardConnect would pursue an IPO instead.
7.  I had a subsequent conversation with Brian Shanahan shortly after CardConnect held its IPO. He specifically said, and I quote: “You missed the boat.”
8.   In that same conversation with Brian Shanahan following CardConnect’s failed IPO, I indicated that I would be interested in pursuing a merger of Shift4 and CardConnect if it was a true merger of equals, or if Shift4 was
the acquirer.
9. The statements referenced above regarding CardConnect were not made by me, and do not reflect Shift4’s intentions regarding a potential transaction with Princeton Payment Solutions.
10. I never told Brian Shanahan, directly or indirectly, that I would be open to CardConnect acquiring Shift4.
11. I never had, nor would I want to under any circumstance, a side-deal for employment with CardConnect.
12. It is not accurate to state that I had several discussions with CardConnect regarding a detailed plan for 2016.
I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that the foregoing is true and correct.
Executed on June 4, 2018.</li>

limitation the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and the
rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, and that such Laws, rules and regulations prohibit any
Person who has received from an issuer material, non-public information concerning the matters

Information to any Person other than to Representatives of Shift4 who reasonably need to know the
Confidential Information for the purpose of assisting Shift4 in evaluating, negotiating or
consummating an Acquisition Transaction and are informed of the confidential nature of the
Confidential Information and directed to comply with the terms of this Section 2. As used
herein,
the term “Person” shall be broadly interpreted to include any corporation, company, limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, other entity, group (as such term is defined
in
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) or individual.
(c) The term “Confidential Information” shall mean any information concerning
the Company or its Subsidiaries (whether prepared by Parent, the Company, their respective
Affiliates or their respective advisors), including, but not limited to, information relating to
Parent,
the Company or their respective Subsidiaries’ customers, suppliers, products and services,
technical information, pricing, marketing and sales information, operations, employee lists,
personnel information, financial information, business and strategic plans, and any notes,
analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies or any other documents, whether in written, oral,
electronic or other form, relating to Parent, the Company, their respective Affiliates or their
respective businesses which is provided by or on behalf of Parent or the Company or any of their
respective Representatives to Shift4 or any of its Representatives; provided that such term shall
not include information that (i) at the time of disclosure is, or thereafter becomes, generally
available to and known by the public (other than as a result of its disclosure by Shift4 or its
Representatives in violation of this Agreement), (ii) was within Shift4’s or its
Representative’s
possession prior to it being furnished to Shift4 or any of its Representatives by or on behalf of
Parent or the Company, provided that the source of such information was not bound by a
contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to Parent or the Company, or any of
their respective Affiliates, with respect to such information, (iii) becomes available to Shift4 or
any of its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than Parent or the
Company, any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives, provided
that such source is not known by Shift4 to be bound by a contractual, legal or fiduciary
obligation of confidentiality to Parent, the Company, any of their respective Affiliates or any of
their respective Representatives with respect to such information or (iv) is independently
developed by Shift4 or its Representatives without use of, reference to, or reliance upon,
the
Confidential Information.</p>
<p>(d) If Shift4 or any of its Representatives is requested or required to disclose
any of
the Confidential Information under the terms of a subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar
legal process, Shift4 shall, to the extent permitted by Law, provide the Company with prompt
notice upon receipt of such request or demand so that the Company may seek (at the Company’s
sole expense) an appropriate protective order and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement. Shift4 shall reasonably cooperate with the Company (at the Company’s sole expense)
to obtain such a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If such order or remedy is not
obtained, and Shift4 is nonetheless, in the opinion of its outside counsel, legally compelled to
disclose Confidential Information, Shift4 or its Representative may disclose only that portion of
the Confidential Information that is, based on the advice of its outside counsel, legally required
to be disclosed.
(e) During the Confidentiality Period, none of Shift4 or any of its Affiliates will
initiate contact with any officer, director, employee, agent or representative of Parent, the
Company or any of their Subsidiaries regarding the business, operations, prospects, finances or
potential Acquisition Transaction without the prior written consent of the Company.</p>
<p>Section 3. Standstill.
(a) Shift4 hereby agrees that, from the date hereof until earlier of (i) the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (ii) the first (1st) anniversary of
the date hereof (such period, the “Standstill Period”), neither it nor any of its Affiliates or
Representatives acting on its behalf will in any manner, directly or indirectly, without the
prior
written consent of, or other authorization by, the Board of Directors of Parent:
(i) acquire, offer or seek to acquire, agree to acquire or propose to acquire,
by
purchase or otherwise, or direct or participate in any acquisition or proposed acquisition of (A)
any ownership, including beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange
Act)
of any voting securities of Parent or any of Parent’s Subsidiaries, any securities convertible into
or
exchangeable for voting securities of Parent or any of Parent’s Subsidiaries, any options or other
rights to acquire voting securities of Parent or any of Parent's Subsidiaries, or any other securities
of Parent or any of Parent’s Subsidiaries, or (B) all or any material portion of the assets
(including
equity interests in any Subsidiary) or businesses of Parent or any of Parent’s Subsidiaries;
(ii) acquire, offer or seek to acquire, agree to acquire or propose to acquire,
by
purchase or otherwise, or direct or participate in any acquisition or proposed acquisition of any
interest in any indebtedness of Parent or any of Parent’s Subsidiaries;
(iii) make, or in any way participate in, directly or indirectly, any “solicitation” of
“proxies” (as such terms are used in the rules of the SEC) to vote, or seek to advise or
influence
any Person with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of Parent;
(iv) make any public announcement with respect to, or offer, seek or propose,
or
indicate an interest in, or encourage, advise or assist any third party to do any of the foregoing
or,
with respect to any merger, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, sale of all or
substantially all of Parent’s assets, tender or exchange offer or similar extraordinary
transaction
involving Parent (any such transaction, an “Acquisition Transaction”);
-3-</p>
<p>(v) form, join or in any way participate in a “group” (as defined in Section
13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) with respect to any voting securities of Parent;
(vi) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control
or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of Parent;
(vii) take any action that would reasonably be expected to require Parent
to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of an Acquisition Transaction;
(viii) enter into any discussions, negotiations, arrangements or agreements
with any other Person relating to any Acquisition Transaction;
(ix) request Parent or any of Parent’s Representatives, directly
or indirectly,
to amend or waive any provision of this Section 3 (including this sentence),
or
(x) take any action which would, in effect, circumvent any of the provisions
of this Section 3.</p>
<p>Shift4 also agrees during the Standstill Period not to, and to cause its Affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly, take any action that is or would reasonably be expected to force Parent or
any of its
Affiliates to make any public announcement regarding the matters set forth
in this Section 3.
(b) Shift4 acknowledges and agrees that any violation of this Section 3 shall constitute
an
intentional and material breach of this Agreement.
(c) In the event that, during the Standstill Period, the board of directors of Parent or
the
Company publicly announces that it has determined to pursue an Acquisition Transaction (the
“Solicited Sale Process”) with a Person other than Shift4 (the “Alternative Acquiror'), which
Acquisition Transaction may imply a value per share for any of the voting securities of Parent (“Per
Share Value”) greater than the Per Share Value implied in the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, then (i) Shift4 and its Affiliates shall, to the extent requested by Parent in
writing, have the opportunity to, and shall be permitted to, propose to Parent and its Affiliates
an
Acquisition Transaction (the “Shift4 Acquisition Transaction”), and (ii) for a period of thirty
(30) days following the date Shift4 received such written request, such Acquisition Transaction
shall be subject to the exclusivity, confidentiality and standstill provisions of the LOI as
though
the LOI were effective as of the date Shift4 received such written request; provided, however, that
for the avoidance of doubt, the other sections of the LOI shall not be deemed effective. After the
conclusion of such thirty (30) day period described in this Section 3(c), this Agreement, including
without limitation this Section 3(c) and Section 3(a), and the LOI shall be terminated and have no
further force or effect solely with respect to the Shift4 Acquisition Transaction, and Shift4 or any
of its Affiliates' ability to pursue, propose, negotiate and consummate the Shift4 Acquisition
Transaction; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not otherwise be affected.</p>
<p>Section 4.
Miscellaneous.</p>
<p>(a) This Agreement and the agreements referenced herein constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof, including the LOI (other than Section 3(c) (Confidentiality),
the last sentence of Section 4(a) (Exclusivity), Section 5 (Expenses), Section 6 (Notices), Section
7 (Governing Law) and Section 8 (Jurisdiction) of the LOI); provided, that this Agreement shall
not
supersede any applicable terms of the Merger Agreement. This Agreement shall not be assigned
by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of each of the other parties.</p>
<p>-4-</p>
<p>(b) The provisions of Sections 5.1(e), 9.3, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8,
9.9, 9.10, 9.11 and 9.12
of the Merger Agreement are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth herein
with the
same force and effect, and shall apply mutatis mutandis to this Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Key Findings and Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exhibit Q (Declaration of J.D. Oder II):</strong>  This declaration directly addresses claims made about Oder's and Shift4's intentions regarding a potential merger or acquisition involving CardConnect.  Oder states he made it clear to Brian Shanahan he <em>wouldn't</em> allow Shift4 to be acquired by CardConnect, but he indicated Shift4 coudl be the aquirer, or a merger of equals/</li>
<li><strong>Exhibit 194 (Text Message Communications):</strong> The text messages reveal internal discussions at Shift4 about potentially acquiring &quot;Princeton&quot; (likely Princeton Payment Solutions) and how that might influence a deal with &quot;ccon&quot; (likely CardConnect). The specific mention of &quot;$350 [million]&quot; for Princeton and a possible effect of acquisition of Ccon for &quot;$650 [million]&quot; is highly relevant to understanding Shift4's strategy. This corroborates other testimony regarding the relative valuations and acquisition strategy.</li>
