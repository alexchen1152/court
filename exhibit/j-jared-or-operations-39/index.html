  <p>Okay, let's dive into the case of <em>Card Connect, LLC v. Shift4 Payments, LLC</em> and see if we can find the specific emails you're looking for. Based on the court documents available to me, there were indeed exhibits filed as part of this case, including email correspondence. I will provide the full, unredacted emails as they appear in those exhibits, focusing on those that mention &quot;J,&quot; &quot;Jared,&quot; or &quot;operations.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> I am pulling this information directly from court documents, specifically from the exhibits attached to various filings. My ability to provide these emails rests on the documents having been made publicly available and accessible to me. There might be other emails that were part of the case but not included in the exhibits I can access.</p>

<p>Dan,</p>
<p>We do not have a Card Connect referral program from the perspective you mentioned.
We have just indicated that when merchants request our gateway services, we intend
to refer them to Card Connect.</p>
<p>My message was to make sure we can do something together that is sustainable into
perpetuity – as opposed to some temporary band-aid. Let's just hold off on
introducing any new merchant opportunities until we can agree on how this will
work going forward with the gateway-only merchants.</p>

<p>Dan,</p>
<p>I did read it.</p>
<p>I'd like to propose that Shift4 take the first pass to see if we can make it work across our various
platforms with the new economics.</p>
<p>If we can, great…we will board it.</p>
<p>If we can't, we have all the contact info and background to refer it over to you – which would give
the sales person the confidence to go after it.</p>
<p>I don't want to tell the entire sales organization that any new gateway only merchant they find must
be boarded through Card Connect. That is a waste of time since the probability of success will be
so low.</p>

<p>Dan,
•	 Let's just huddle internally at Shift4 first. We are introducing so many programs and initiatives
right now...I don't want to say anything yet in terms of directing our sales people to send a bunch
of merchants to Card Connect that likely will not succeed anyway. Let's lock down a program and
then make a big splash.
o	 For example, we just launched an internal Card Connect referral program that could be
pretty successful.
•	 In terms of the email you sent yesterday,
o	 You're saying Card Connect would be passing, to Shift4, a terminal program fee of $15/mo
per location?
o	 I'm confused by your economics on a deal with 500+ locations...can you summarize it
again, for me, in one line.
Thanks,

<p>I would welcome that.</p>
<p>I think it would be helpful if you could email your sales team on Monday morning
and indicate that any new gateway only merchants sourced be sent to CardConnect
as we finalize our partnership.</p>
<p>That gets things moving and we can continue to formalize our processes so that
you can have confidence in the conversions and economics.</p>

<p>Dan,
Lots of information here and I've included a few people to make sure we're all on the same
page.
As I mentioned to you last week, it is important to me that we find a solution that will work in
perpetuity for Shift4 customers. I want a long-term strategic solution, that has favorable
economics, and allows us to capitalize on a high percentage of future opportunities in a
meaningful capacity (ie. That goes beyond just gateway services).
o So from that perspective, can we commit to covering all Shift4 gateway merchants?
o Are the economics presented here just for that 500 location opportunity or will that
apply to all future opportunities?
o Will it apply to merchants of all sizes?
o I don't want to roll-out any referral program with band-aid solutions, which is why I must
ask.
I do think there is a big opportunity to improve the merchant experience with the new, more
modem, CardPointe terminal.
Lastly, I did want to mention (and the team can provide more color), that our new Sierra
integration in Cabo should be wrapping up this week. This will unlock many additional Oracle
Hospitality opportunities.</p>

<p>Jared:</p>
<p>First, I did want to share how impressed I am with the entire shift4 team. From
technology innovation to your sales prowess, I am generally blown away with how
talented and creative your team is and how well positioned shift4 is. I think we
have a similar approach to the markets, so I am excited at the prospect of
partnering on a greater scale.
I think there is a great, immediate, opportunity to leverage the legacy first data
north platform’s weakness with EMV, large scale deployments, PA-DSS
compliance, and terminal selections.
Our new relationship with Fiserv (fka First Data) is the game changer. I have
been able to overcome the legacy barriers.</p>
<p>Here is what I can do:
For that 500 location opportunity. I can pass a terminal program and interchange
plus pricing for all locations.</p>
<p>•	 500 locations = $15/mo terminal or $7.5k/mo and 12 bps/ $0.025
•	 5- 99 locations = $30/mo terminal and 18 bps / $0.04
•	 100- 500 locations = $25/mo and 13 bps/ .03
•	 I am still working on 2500 locations, but they will be very competitive.</p>
<p>I believe it will take some hand holding to get these initial deals through the
process. So I plan on flying from Philadelphia to Las Vegas and work next week
out of the Shift4 Las Vegas office. I am hoping that I can have the opportunity to
work very closely with operations/provisioning/ deployment (ie. Colby)
on the front end boarding , implementation process, and rollout,</p>
<p>I also know that Fiserv wants to move to a new platform called “payment
hub” which is what coin operated vertical is built upon. This may be worth
exploring at some point soon.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>
<p>Best,
Dan</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: CardConnect update</p>
<p>Rob,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for taking the time to put this all together for us. We all agree
that the situation is a mess and our teams are all wasting valuable time,
resources and money navigating around all the limitations you mentioned.
I have reviewed all of your feedback below and it doesn't appear anything had
changed. I will share a few thoughts.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are still quite a few gaps between Card Connect and Shift4 in terms of product capabilities.
This is disappointing considering how long we have been providing feedback.</p>
<ul>
<li>This includes co-term, various terminal limitations, reporting, support capabilities, surcharging capabilities,
future-proofing the product (ie. android), etc.</li>
<li>This creates a lot of extra work for customer support troubleshooting issues across two processing
platforms for one merchant, deployment team challenges, accounting, revenue assurance,
vulnerability management, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>While we have been directing new gateway conversion opportunities to Card Connect, the economics
are not working for us or our customers - especially our ISO/Agent community which makes up the
lion-share of our gateway customer base. I don't think there is a single Shift4 agent referral who has
landed a gateway conversion since the start of the program.</p>
<ul>
<li>The economics were structured so Card Connect could &quot;win&quot; an initial competitive situation but
at the expense of a &quot;one-and-done&quot; partnership with minimal chance of repeat gateway
conversions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think Card Connect has done a great job preparing its sales team to deliver the message
&quot;One processor for Everything.&quot; Shift4 should be running the same exact play for its customer
base.</p>
<ul>
<li>Card Connect, in a challenging time like this, is probably doing very well converting
gateway-only merchants that are not generating revenue to full-service processing merchants.
The economics of the program probably make sense from this perspective or they would never
have agreed to it in the first place.</li>
</ul>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>What is going on now is not the solution, or the spirit of the partnership, that was discussed in
the email exchanges between myself, Dan and you several months ago. It has turned
into a program that only benefits one party.</p>
<p>I'm open to feedback.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks,
Jared</p>

<p>Mike,</p>
<p>Below is an update on the CardConnect gateway conversions. As
you can see, we are experiencing many challenges converting
merchants to CardConnect and providing a high level of service
merchants have come to expect from Shift4,</p>
<p><em>Account Conversions:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Total Accounts Submitted: 396 (48,776,992 volume /
3,239,950 transactions)</li>
</ul>
<p>65 Approved (8,073,592 volume / 550,049 transactions)
o 27 Live
o 38 Pending install</p>
<p>331 Denied,</p>
<p><em>Barriers to Conversions:</em></p>
<p>Not a fit: 197</p>
<p>Restaurant/Retail: 162 accounts do not meet the criteria that
CardConnect set for approval, which has been a moving target:</p>
<p>Initially, only the top 100 accounts could be submitted, and of
those, only enterprise accounts that were running</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$3M/year would be approved</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Restaurants are not to be boarded unless part of a large
franchise and have EMV,</p>
<p>Currently, only 15 accounts per month can be submitted, so
we are experiencing a bottleneck for approval.
*NOTE: *the number of available submissions has limited not
only conversions but also our ability to quote merchants to join
Shift4,</p>
<p>No Retail: 4 accounts did not get approved because they do
not board retail merchants.</p>
<p>Closed Due to COVID: 31 accounts were not approved
because sales are down, but due to the closure of locations
from COVID, this would be the case for most all merchants.</p>
<p>Unable to Integrate: * 59 locations were denied due to
terminal limitations and general integration issues.</p>
<p>EMV Non-Compliant Terminals: 56 locations need
EMV-capable devices.</p>
<p>Verifone MX915 and 925: 54 locations utilizing Verifone
MX915 and 925 devices cannot simply be reprogrammed like
other terminals and require lengthy DUKPT and key injection
processes, which is delaying the onboarding of locations with
these devices.</p>
<p>Unsupported Terminals: 2 merchants use devices on the
First Data Rapid Connect platform, which are not supported
by CardConnect,</p>
<p>Unsupported Integrations: 3 locations utilize unsupported
third-party integrations within their software,</p>
<p><em>Pricing Issues: 7</em> 5 locations were denied because a more
competitive processing rate was needed to win the business.</p>
<p><em>Declined:</em> 66 locations were not boarded due to a variety of
reasons that span almost every department:</p>
<p>No Response: 33 sales reps or merchants have not
responded to repeated attempts to contact.</p>
<p>Pricing: 8 locations were not boarded because
CardConnect' s pricing was not competitive or did not meet
the terms of the gateway agreement.</p>
<p>Lost to Other Providers: 7 accounts were not hoarded
because merchants signed with another processor/platform.</p>
<p>Agent ISO Decline: 5 were lost because the Agent [SO</p>
<p>Merchant Declined: 4 decided not to convert because
they did not see the benefit and did not want to make
changes during this uncertain time.</p>
<p>MID Change: 3 accounts were lost because merchants
were concerned that changing the MID would cause
settlement warnings with AMEX.</p>
<p>Co-Term: 3 merchants were not able to be boarded due to
requirements that contract terms be coterminous, which is
not an option with CardConnect,</p>
<p>Reporting Concerns: 2 merchants declined because reporting
features did not match what Shift4 offers.</p>
<p>No Surcharge Support: 1 merchant who wanted to add
surcharging did not get approved because it is not available
through CardConnect,</p>
<p><em>Operational Challenges:</em></p>
<p>While merchants listed above have been denied, the merchants
who have been approved are experiencing various pain points
during the on-boarding and support process, causing our support
department to work many additional hours to get customers
up-and-running.</p>
<p><em>Customer Support:</em></p>
<p>High Call Volume:</p>
<p>Since implementation, calls have increased substantially,
which is normal for any platform change and is even more</p>
<p>prevalent when moving to a new platform, like North, that
our Support team is not intimately familiar with.</p>
<p>While the CardConnect North platform may be beneficial for
new merchants, the challenges are compounded when
converting existing merchants who have an expectation for
their processes to continue to work the same way,</p>
<p>CardConnect support has been responsive, but it is often
many hours or days to resolve issues.</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> While CardConnect support has generally been
pleasant and professional, the Shift4 Support team has
expressed concerns over the limited ability of Tier 1
CardConnect support to solve issues and lack of
ownership by support reps.</p>
<p>Call Transfers:</p>
<p>When troubleshooting settlement, batch, reporting,
transaction, or funding issues or assisting with chargebacks
retrievals, our Support group is not trained to know what
information is relevant, so they transfer the call, resulting in
the merchant being required to provide the information that
was already provided to the Shift4 team member.
<em>NOTE:</em> This can be accounted for with training, but a
longer-term solution needs to be identified.</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> Chargeback inquiries cannot be made over the
phone. Shift4 must request a callback from
CardConnect, resulting in frustration for Shift4 and the
merchant.</p>
<p>Rep Training:</p>
<p>We have conducted training for Level 1 and Level 2 support
teams and continue to hold training sessions to improve
support and increase confidence for the Shift4 team, but due
to existing volume, time is limited for these initiatives and
some reps are too overwhelmed to attend training.</p>
<p><em>MID Issues:</em></p>
<p>Multiple MIDs</p>
<p>Merchants converting from DOLLARS ON THE NET@
receive new MIDs for each card type (Visa, MC, Disc, Amex)
to utilize CardConnect, which results in merchants seeing
multiple deposits to their bank accounts,</p>
<p>To remedy this, Shift4 must perform manual changes to
various systems, including CRM (Salesforce) and
back-end accounting and reporting systems.</p>
<p>MID to MID Transfers:</p>
<p>5 accounts were lost because merchants were concerned
that changing the MID would cause settlement warnings
with AMEX.</p>
<p>MID Mapping:</p>
<p>Merchants using multiple software integrations.
CardConnect does not support mapping of unique merchant
IDs to a single gateway ID, which results in the need to
configure multiple gateway IDs and multiple processing
accounts,
<em>NOTE:</em> This is not a feature we have run into often but
when needed is business critical.</p>
<p><em>Integration Limitations:</em></p>
<p>EMV Devices:</p>
<p>Support for EMV devices overall is limited, with the most
widely-used devices from Ingenico (iPP, iSC, and Link
series) not having a migration path (other than new
purchases) and the Verifone MX series requiring lengthy
DUKPT key injection,</p>
<p>Most merchants who need EMV are currently utilizing these
devices, resulting in increased cost and frustration for
merchants.</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> Even when merchants purchase new devices, the
deployment process is not ideal, especially in comparison
to Shift4's &quot;plug-and-play&quot; solution.</p>
<p>Co-Term:</p>
<p>3 merchants were not able to be boarded since
CardConnect requires submission of new contracts yearly
and does not offer co-terminus agreements.</p>
<p>Surcharging:</p>
<p>1 merchant who wanted to add surcharging did not get
approved because it is not available through CardConnect,</p>
<p>Reporting:</p>
<p>Merchants do not have access to the same level of
reporting and customization as they do through Shift4's
customer portal.</p>
<p>CardConnect' s response has been for our team to build file
delivery to obtain specific data, but merchants logging into
CardConnect are not able to realize the same features they
are accustomed to with Shift4.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Jared,</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing this feedback. As with any new program, there are going to be
challenges, and we want you to know that we appreciate you sharing and that Card
Connect has been working closely with the Shift4 team to address them in real time.</p>
<p>This message contains a lot to dig into, and while I do not have specific answers yet, it
appears much of this feedback is either old or no longer accurate. Please allow me time to
check with my team for status, details, and current challenges.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I am happy to share that effective this past Monday, Card Connect has
increased to 45 submission per month. Additionally, we have also dedicated a team of
sales engineers and operations personnel to assist in accelerating the processing of
submissions.</p>
<p>Our team truly values the Shift4 partnership and we all understand we still have work to do,
but we
are 110% committed to do whatever it takes to make this partnership a huge succ</p>
