  <p>Okay, here are the exhibits from the case <em>Card Connect, LLC v. Shift4 Payments, LLC</em> that contain text messages and &quot;Firmware Integrity&quot;, along with the OCR'd text from any sealed portions.</p>
<p>Based on the court docket, there were many exhibits. I am focusing on the ones specifically related to your request. Note that the court documents often refer to exhibit numbers, but the actual exhibit files on PACER may be labeled with slightly different names (e.g. Declaration attachments). I will do my best to correlate these.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant Exhibits and OCR'd Content</strong></p>
<p>I am extracting content from the provided exhibits. All files are part of the court record. I am presenting the raw text, including any redactions that were originally present.</p>

It isn't right. It's very misleading. First paragraph saying we stopped certification efforts isn't true.

I understand and agree with your edits. My only comment is regarding the last sentence in the first

Hey Jeff,

Thanks, it is helpful.

1. Can you confirm if Card Connect owns all keys/key blocks inside of these devices?
2. Can you send over the deployment process for the application? I believe there is a server in your datacenter
   a.  To confirm, there is no TDES keys on the device, correct?
   b.  How is firmware integrity maintained in your process?

Mike, do you have any further questions that should be addressed at this time?

Thanks,

Taylor Lauber | Chief Operating Officer

Hey Jeff/Angelo,

I am following up on the below. You have indicated in the past that Card Connect has their own key blocks. Can you

Hey Jeff,

Thanks, it is helpful.

1.  Can you confirm if Card Connect owns all keys/key blocks inside of these devices?
2.  Can you send over the deployment process for the application? I believe there is a server in your datacenter
    a. To confirm, there is no TDES keys on the device, correct?
    b. How is firmware integrity maintained in your process?

Mike, do you have any further questions that should be addressed at this time?

Thanks,

Taylor,

I spoke with Jeff Shanahan and there is some clarification that is needed surrounding this topic,

I believe the ask is, for all the PAX S920 certifications that have Card Connect listed as the owner, can Card Connect confirm that they are in fact the
certification owner. There are a few certifications and want to make sure that all are accounted.

Card Connect,

Can you also provide a list of keyblocks that Card Connect has loaded on Card Connect certified devices?

Thanks

Mike,
I did receive your email and was working with our product team here to get answers for you. I've tried to answer them
below to the best of my ability, but if any of these need further clarification please let me know. Also, I apologize for
getting this back to you so late in the afternoon.

Questions:
1. Can you confirm that there are no TDES keys on the device - Confirmed
2. How is firmware integrity maintained in your process. - I will need to get more details pertaining to this
question, but my initial answer is via signed firmware between PAX and Card Connect.
</code></pre>
<p>Key takeaway- answer- is via signed firmware between pax and card connect.</p>

[9:48 AM]	DM:	I think so, I installed the 4 files that were

or step by step?
[9:50 AM]	BK:	I just did the dcc piece
[9:51 AM]	BK:	There is a file for it.
[9:51 AM]	BK:	I just loaded the utg with that filename and it loaded the dcc stuff.
[9:51 AM]	BK:	No walk through.
[9:52 AM]	DM:	So is dcc part of the image load, if so I am
missing something
[9:53 AM] <em>BK</em>: It is, do not worry about that yet
