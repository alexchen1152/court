<blockquote>
<p>Per our recent email conversation with legal, it appears that the Card Connect program may not actually
&quot;take&quot; very long to dismantle from a contractual perspective. It seems pretty vanilla with very brief
commitment time-frames, etc. for them. No big terms to negotiate out of or anything.
Therefore...I have modified my prior email and attached notes to represent the version of the program that I
think we should roll-out with.
I have added just 2 tiny, logical tweaks to my prior version, below. One benefits our sales partners, the
other benefits the Company.
Please provide any feedback ASAP.
Thanks.

Any update?
06/10/16,4:50 PM
I reviewed the documents
Not bad and I understand it better now
JDO</p>
<ol>
<li>It is annual contract subject to auto renewal for successive 1 year terms</li>
<li>The only termination event is upon 30 day notice of a &quot;material&quot; breach</li>
<li>No termination without cause provision</li>
<li>The payment schedule says no referral fees are payable if &quot;agreement terminates for any reason*</li>
<li>This whole thing expires in June of 2017</li>
<li>This could be deemed a highly beneficial agreement, with great rates, fees and services
So, I am just trying to get a pulse on our potential exposure
But it appears as if these contracts are not that exclusive, you can turn them off fairly easily and they
were focused on growing the business with us.

That's what my recent email said

I agree. We are hoping that he is too busy to work on our shit.
I texted him this week and reminded him that we have a call this week. I think he stalled to get a full

Hi Dave,
Attached is the list of current, active merchants that we have on file for the Lighthouse/Shift4 portfolio.
•	 I've highlighted the merchants that are active with SkyTab.
•	 I've also confirmed that they have signed the most recent Merchant Agreement, Addendums A&amp;B.
I'll follow up with a separate email regarding next steps on the legal conversations.

My understanding from some of our recent conversations is:
•	 There are some docs &quot;floating around&quot; related to the SkyTab program.
•	 We would like to get those ASAP.
•	 We also would like to get a list of the merchants that are actually set-up under the Card Connect/Shift4/SkyTab
umbrella.
Can you assist?
Thanks.

Hi Catherine,
I'm happy to help-we can put this under the Shift4/Lighthouse relationship
so that it can get booked appropriately onto TSYS.
Is the updated merchant agreement a condition of receiving SkyTab for all
merchants? If so, there should be some additional language specific to the
program and deployment expectations.
I can help with this.

RE: CardConnect - Shift4 Payments
Hi Dave,
I wanted to reach out and provide an update, as well as request a follow up call to discuss the termination of the
Lighthouse Network ISA Agreement.
As you know, Lighthouse Networks (&quot;LHN&quot;) has had an Independent Sales Agent Agreement with CardConnect (&quot;CC&quot;)
since August of 2014. CardConnect has been providing LHN (and now Shift4 Payments &quot;S4P&quot;) with preferential
pricing in addition to a preferred revenue share arrangement. This includes approximately [REDACTED] basis points of margin
above our standard pricing terms.
In addition to the preferred pricing, CardConnect also made a significant investment to integrate EMV capabilities for
Shift4's gateway to the TSYS platform.
<em>Page 2.</em>
Despite our efforts, we have experienced minimal return on this investment. While we appreciate the
continued, positive dialog and remain hopeful of a turnaround, there are factors that are forcing us to
re-evaluate this relationship.
Since the acquisition of LHN, Shift4 Payments has:</p>
<ol>
<li>Directly contracted with First Data</li>
<li>Shift4 is listed as a registered agent of Wells Fargo Bank &amp; Elavon (via FD)
On the most recent calls with Shift4, there have been conversations about CardConnect's preferred
pricing commitment. As of date, the volume associated with this portfolio is approx. $38M (2016 YTD),
netting CardConnect less than $500 in profit per month. Given the level of investment, we have yet to
break even on our costs.
<em>Page 3.</em>
We want to be clear and upfront that a termination of the LHN ISA Agreement with CC will also
necessitate a termination is pricing terms and revenue share arrangement.
That all being said, can you confirm a time to connect
with myself, Jerry &amp; Mike Duffy next week? We would propose either Monday (11/14) or
Tuesday (11/15) at 12pm EST.
I look forward to connecting!
A.</li>

<p><em>Pages 4 and on</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This contains contact info for Angela Frank and previous emails already covered in prior exhibits. There are repeats of prior emails.</p>
<p><strong>Key observations and Summary of findings across the exhibits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timeline:</strong>  The exhibits follow a timeline starting around June 2016, when Shift4 is actively considering, and starts building, its own credit card processing program, and extends through late 2016, when Card Connect is signaling its intent to terminate the agreement due to low profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Contract Status:</strong> The text messages and emails reveal an initial understanding that the Card Connect contract was &quot;vanilla&quot; and easily terminated (Exhibit 7), but subsequent discussions show a more complex situation with potentially 400 active merchants under the agreement (Exhibit 8).  There's also discussion about the agreement auto-renewing annually and only being terminable for &quot;material&quot; breach (Exhibit 7).</li>
<li><strong>Shift4's Actions:</strong> Shift4 appears to be actively developing a competing processing solution.  They are discussing alternatives to Card Connect and First Data (Exhibit 23), and Shift4 eventually contracts directly with First Data (Exhibit 28).</li>
<li><strong>Negotiations &amp; Stalling:</strong> Shift4 and Card Connect engage in negotiations regarding the contract, but Shift4 seemingly delays sending proposed terms (Exhibit 14). There's a mention of hoping Card Connect is &quot;too busy to work on our shit&quot; (Exhibit 9).</li>
<li><strong>Card Connect's Concerns:</strong> Card Connect expresses concerns about the low volume and profitability of the Shift4/Lighthouse portfolio (Exhibit 28). They note that they haven't broken even on their investment in integrating EMV capabilities for Shift4.</li>
<li><strong>Skytab:</strong> Several of the messages focus around the usage of Skytab and what type of merchant agreement is needed to use the device.</li>
</ul>
<p>This covers the content and context of the provided exhibits containing text messages and &quot;Paperwork&quot;.I can elaborate further on the ISA Agreement from any specific angle that may be of interest if needed. I will not make interpretations, just state facts.</p>
