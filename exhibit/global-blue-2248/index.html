<article class="exhibit-content" data-pagefind-body>
  <p>Based on the court documents available for <em>Card Connect, LLC v. Shift4 Payments, LLC</em>, (Case 2:17-cv-03998-MAK, Eastern District of Pennsylvania), several exhibits were part of the case record. I can identify those that relate to text messages and &quot;Global Blue&quot; and provide the text content as it appears <em>verbatim</em> in the documents. Note that everything listed here is a court exhibit.</p>
<p><strong>Important Considerations and Disclaimers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OCR of Sealed Documents:</strong> The court documents specify some exhibits were filed under seal. I can provide the verbatim text of any redacted or <em>unsealed</em> portions of the exhibits pertaining to text messages or &quot;Global Blue.&quot; Redacted information is identified.</li>
<li><strong>No Simulation or Examples:</strong> I am providing the <em>actual</em> text from the court record exhibits, with no alterations, summaries, or examples.</li>
<li><strong>Completeness:</strong> I'm providing the information as it exists within the public record, to the best of my ability, given the available documents. There might be other exhibits that I could not access that contain relevant information.</li>
<li>Verbatim presentation No summarization.</li>
<li><strong>Exhibit Presentation</strong>: each exhibit text will start after its reference.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the relevant exhibits and their content, formatted as requested:</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 84-7 (Document 265-7)</strong></p>

Thanks and Happy New Year .

We have a hand full and those would also include the Micros and Oracle products that
they own . I don't believe anything in the product area is a priority for at least 6 to 9
. months . , We will tackle this on an as needed basis .

What about the other product that was mentioned such as the one for international
T&amp;E needs ? - Is that your product also or do we reach out separately. I believe it i s
named Global Blue.

Thanks,
