<article class="exhibit-content" data-pagefind-body>
  <p>Okay, let's break down this request and then address the specifics of finding and presenting the exhibits from <em>Card Connect, LLC v. Shift4 Payments, LLC</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding the Request</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Case Identification:</strong>  We're dealing with the case <em>Card Connect, LLC v. Shift4 Payments, LLC</em>.  This is crucial for searching court records.  Knowing the court (jurisdiction) where the case was filed is essential, as that determines where the records are held.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exhibit Request:</strong> The request is for <em>exhibits</em> from the case. Exhibits are pieces of evidence (documents, photos, objects, etc.) presented during a trial or other legal proceedings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Specific Content Focus:</strong>  The core of the request is for exhibits containing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text Messages:</strong>  We are specifically looking for communications in text message format.</li>
<li><strong>Phone Number:</strong> The phone number &quot;068585635204&quot; must be present. This strongly suggests we're looking for communication <em>to</em> or <em>from</em> this number. <em>Important Note: that look like an international number</em></li>
<li><strong>PDF Format Preference and OCR:</strong> Exhibits that are in PDF format are preferred. Furthermore, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) should be applied. OCR converts images of text (like a scanned document or a screenshot of a text message) into machine-readable text, making it searchable and copyable.</li>
<li><strong>PDF Format Preference and OCR:</strong> Exhibits that are in PDF format are prefeered. Furthermore, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) should be applied. OCR converts image of text (like, scanned document or a screenshot of a text message) into machine-readable text, making it searchable and copyable.</li>
<li><strong>No Redactions:</strong>  This is a critical point. Redactions are the blacking out of sensitive information. The request explicitly prohibits any redaction, meaning we need the <em>full, uncensored</em> content of the exhibits. This has significant legal and privacy implications.</li>
<li><strong>No summarization:</strong> This means that extracted contet should copy and show original raw context without any modification or summarization.</li>
<li><strong>Use all tokens:</strong> I should show every single related page to satisfy the request, and leave noting out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Challenges and Legal Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Before I proceed with attempting to locate the exhibits, it's absolutely vital to highlight several major challenges and legal hurdles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Public Access to Court Records:</strong>  While court records are often public, access varies significantly.  Some records are readily available online (through systems like PACER in the US federal courts, or state-level court websites), while others require specific requests, payment of fees, or even in-person visits to the courthouse.  The specific court where this case was filed is <em>essential</em> to know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sealed or Confidential Records:</strong>  It's very common for exhibits in legal cases to be filed under seal or to be subject to protective orders.  This means they are <em>not</em> publicly accessible.  If the exhibits containing the text messages were deemed confidential (e.g., to protect trade secrets, personal privacy, or ongoing investigations), we will <em>not</em> be able to obtain them through public means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Privacy Concerns (Unredacted Information):</strong>  The request for <em>unredacted</em> text messages raises major privacy concerns.  Text messages often contain highly personal and sensitive information.  Releasing unredacted communications without proper authorization could violate privacy laws (like GDPR, CCPA, etc.) and potentially expose individuals to harm.  This is a significant legal risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>International Number format:</strong> The phone number is the format of international format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Obtaining Authorization:</strong>  Without being a party to the case (Card Connect or Shift4), their legal representatives, or having a court order, accessing unredacted exhibits is highly unlikely and potentially illegal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Steps to Attempt to Locate the Exhibits (with Caveats)</strong></p>
<p>Given the significant limitations and legal considerations, here are the steps I can take to <em>attempt</em> to find the exhibits, along with the strong caveats that apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify the Court:</strong>  The first, and most crucial, step is to determine the specific court where the case was filed.  A case name alone is not enough.  We need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> Was it a federal court (and if so, which district)? Was it a state court (and if so, which state and county)?</li>
<li><strong>Case Number:</strong>  Each case is assigned a unique case number. This is essential for searching court databases.</li>
<li>With the case name Card Connect, LLC v. Shift4 Payments, LLC, the case number is 2:15-cv-06228 and it was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Search Online Court Records (PACER and State Equivalents):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records):</strong>  If the case was in a US federal court, PACER is the primary database.  I can search PACER using the case number and party names.  However, accessing documents on PACER requires an account and payment of fees per page.  Critically, even on PACER, sealed or protected documents will <em>not</em> be available.</li>
<li><strong>State Court Websites:</strong>  If the case was in a state court, I would need to search the relevant state court's website.  Access to online records varies widely by state.  Some states have comprehensive online access, while others have very limited or no online access.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Review the Docket:</strong>  The docket is a chronological list of all filings in a case.  If I can access the docket (through PACER or a state system), I can look for entries that mention exhibits being filed.  This might give clues about the existence and timing of relevant exhibits.  However, the docket itself usually doesn't contain the exhibits themselves.Docket is a chronological list of all filings in a case. If i can asses the docket. I can looks entries mentions of exhibits. However, this only provide hints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify Exhibit Filings:</strong>  I will look for docket entries specifically mentioning the filing of exhibits.  These entries might include descriptions like &quot;Exhibit A,&quot; &quot;Plaintiff's Exhibits,&quot; &quot;Defendant's Exhibits,&quot; or similar language. The docket numbers for exhibits are 41-1, 46-1, 53-1, 55-2, 55-3, 55-4, 61-1, 62-1, 64-1, 82-1, 83-1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check for Descriptions Matching Text Messages:</strong>  If I find docket entries for exhibits, I will carefully read the descriptions to see if any suggest they contain text messages or communications related to the phone number &quot;068585635204&quot;. This is a long shot, as descriptions are often brief.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attempt to Access Publicly Available Exhibits:</strong>  If I identify potentially relevant exhibits <em>and</em> they are not marked as sealed or confidential, I can <em>attempt</em> to access them through PACER (for federal cases) or the relevant state court system.  This will likely involve paying fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply OCR:</strong> If the file are PDF, i will apply Optical Character Recognition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Crucial Disclaimer:</strong> I cannot guarantee that I will be able to find the exhibits, even with these steps.  The legal and access restrictions are significant.  Furthermore, I cannot provide unredacted, confidential information without proper legal authorization. I will proceed with the search, but I will prioritize complying with legal and ethical obligations.
I couldn't find the phone number &quot;068585635204&quot; through all the documents.</p>

Randy -

I just left you a voicemail, but wanted to formally respond to the points in your email , so there is a clear record of
our responses . After internal discussion, here are our responses to your specific points:

Settlement Funds - we are holding these funds, as we would with any merchant, because CC is in
breach of the RSA. Specifically, CC breached sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.10 by soliciting/moving our mutual
merchants. I'm sure you understand that we need to protect our revenue stream, and ensure that we are
covered for any losses.

Commissions - see above re: breach of contract.

Text Messages - I spoke to several of my employees/co-workers, and no one admits to sending these
types of texts to a CC employee .. . especially not your CFO: Given the relationship of our companies, I
think it's fair to assume they are not truthful. In any event, I ask that you have your CFO forward the text
messages to me. If one of my employees did this, I will take swift action. But without proof. there is
nothing I can do, other than bring it to the attention of my employees like I have already done .

Non-solicitation of our ISOs - our agreements do not prevent us from working with people that we have
pre-existing relationships with, and/or people who approach us to work with them.

I understand that you are likely upset that some people/companies who were working with you are now
working with us. However, based on the above, you have to understand that there is nothing improper about
that. In addition, you should be working with us a little more closely so you can get first-hand knowledge of
what is actually happening with your former sales agents and not working off rumors .

Feel free to call me to discuss.

Thanks
Jared

Importance: High

Jared,

We have a few very serious items that we need to discuss. I have been trying to reach you,
but have been unsuccessful. I'm hoping that this email will result in a return phone call.
1. Settlement Funds - It has been brought to our attention that you are holding CardConnect's
settlement money hostage. We demand that you release all funds immediately for the following
reasons:
a. This is CardConnect's money and you have no legal right
b. You are jeopardizing merchants by not funding.
2. Commissions-you have chosen to stop paying commissions, after telling us you would (and
confirming by making August's payment). We demand all future commission payments be
distributed timely, along with a payment schedule for the 18 payments you have promised.

3. Text messages - I learned today that other members of your staff have been sending text
messages like the one below, which was sent to our CFO.
a. I have screen shots to forward to you.
b. Threatening a publicly traded company has serious ramification.

4. Non-solicitation of our ISO's- Shift4 and its subsidiaries have agreed not to target, solicit, or
induce ISO's away from CardConnect.
a. We believe this is currently going on.

Your immediate attention to these manners is appreciated. Like I said earlier, I am available
immediately to discuss. .

Thanks,
Randy
