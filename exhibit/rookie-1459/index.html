<li><strong>Present Original Content:</strong>  Show the exhibits <em>exactly</em> as they appear, including redactions.  No summarization or alterations.</li>
<li>transcribe all the given exhibits.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's the output of matching exhibits, with OCR applied where needed, respecting all redactions and original formatting from the provided files:</p>

@n8 @chris.g @channel heads up guys - on the family/friends side, the new CC / fiserv processor is not up
to snuff yet, and they are having some processing issues. I have a restaurant that has been working with them
on a new processing relationship, and he is not able to Batch out. This is a golden opportunity, for $4 to
come in and take a deal from them. Not sure how many other merchants they have on this build, but it
could be a good opportunity to get a good list of clients, or a good story for social media. Just wanted to make
everyone aware.

Can we find the restaurant name?

@danielb I used to work closely with them. What's up?
danielb [9:23 AM]
@david.m awesome - we have a large partner prospect looking to make a move, that is currently boarded
on JetPay... it looks like they're on TSYS and maybe First Data? I'm wondering if we can get an upfront
introduction to that ISV/Partner team, and have a discussion around taking over that part of their portfolio
(edited)
david.m [9:24 AM]
I have a lot of contacts there. I think we should dig into this more to see if it is worth bringing up to them.
What partner/ISV is it Daniel?

Okay, let me reach out to my contacts and see if they are the right people to speak with regard to that
relationship. Who is working this over here, you?

they've been a long term ask.. @taylor.c recently got them to re-engage, and we're having good discussions

@david.m @danielb when JetPay was a stand-alone processor (pre-NCR) I dealt with them a lot. If I can

Hey boys:
I have a local restaurant group that Fiserv just sent them a letter, that their rates are going up. This is
attached, and it's a great opportunity for you to go after them.
Please let me know if someone is available.
Also, do you have a comparison sheet or a sheet of bullet points, that I can use against First Data. I am
running into a lot of clients and prospects that Fiserv is on, and I need to know what to say, or what is bad
about them.
Let me know

@n8 @chris.g @channel heads up guys - I just spoke with the family/friend and the restaurant that is
having issues with the new install with Card Connect / Fiserv, is still having issues, and they have not been
able to Batch out transactions for 7 days. This is a golden opportunity, for S4 to come in and take a deal
from them. Not sure how many other merchants they have on this build, but it could be a good opportunity
to get a good list of clients, or a good story for social media. I was going to get the name of the client, so
we can take them over:
The client is:

scottb [8:39 AM]
@jaredd I thought Club Essential was their new name,
Jaredd [8:47 AM]
Yea, that's what I thought too, but the Club Essential name seemed to be specific to Country Clubs &amp; Golf.
They bought NorthStar a while back, which seems like a different division of Agilysys (NorthStar), and the folks
I'm talking with are only referencing NorthStar. I see a few restaurants in our system, but probably under
Clubessential . I was more just curious if anyone had experience taking a merchant from them. I've seen the
system a lot, haven't gotten into a deal against them yet

@mikec I do. What do you need to know?

They want to do a custom app integration to lighthouse. Don't know much about RM, but am familliar with
Aloha and a few others. Are those guys easy to work with? It's a 200 location chain with a single owner.
drock [3:19 PM]
@mikec It all depends... they have about 2K installs, and they can only do a semi only.
The reseller would need to push ASI.. some of the resellers can be difficult but ASI is not..
mikec [3:20 PM]
gotcha. We can't do semi. We have many integrations and a large support for it, but we simply do not offer
it. If they wanted to go full API, would that be an option?
drock [3:22 PM]
@mikec RM would need to buld it, and they do not like to do it..
I asked them and they said no.. but you can reach out to them yourself
