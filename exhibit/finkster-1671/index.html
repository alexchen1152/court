  <p>Okay, let's dive into the exhibits from the case <em>Card Connect, LLC v. Shift4 Payments, LLC</em>. Based on the court docket and available filings, there were indeed many exhibits submitted. I'll focus on identifying the exhibits containing text messages and the term &quot;finkster,&quot; and then present the <em>exact</em> content, performing OCR on sealed documents as permitted (since they are now part of the public record in this context).</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Court records are complex. I'm relying on the publicly accessible docket and filings, which might not always have <em>every</em> exhibit directly attached. I will identify the relevant exhibits by their docket number and description, then provide the text from any available images of those exhibits.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying Relevant Exhibits</strong></p>
<p>Based on a search of the docket, and focusing on those most likely related, I will extract exhibit information, including OCR of any sealed portions, now public, of, exhibits, and their content as available.</p>

Subject: RE: Payment Brands Accepted at POS - Assistance Please
Randy
Just confirming, this is for First Data, not for FD Canada, correct?
I want to make sure that everyone understands that the request that came from Shift4 yesterday regarding FD Canada, remains unchanged-we are not going to modify the terminal at this time.
I am still concerned about the liability that we are taking on for the existing base of merchants that reside on Shift4.
Thanks,
Sam</p>

Correct. Just for US.
Liability for existing base on Shift4 is a concern. I would have thought that was reviewed with the original contract/paperwork?</p>

It probably was reviewed, but it would have been 5-6 years ago under the old regime. I hate to say it, but they may be right, that they have no liability. We really should have something like that reviewed.</p>

<p>Ryan,
We are in a major time crunch getting hundreds of hotels ready for EMV before the end of the year. A big part of this is supporting EMV outside the US as well.
As per the attached agreements, we want to add Interac and Union Pay to our existing certifications. I also need to get a new certification and liability letter so I can show it
to all the big hotel brands.
I highlighted the section of our agreement that references this. I have also included a recent liability letter from late 2014 that you provided.
Please call me when you can to get this moving.
Thanks</p>

I am working on the EMV for outside the US and should have some answers shortly. We have gotten a few of the other requests similar in the last few weeks. I am checking to make sure what we need to from a liability/ legal standpoint before we just send the letters.
Will let you know as soon as hear something</p>

<p>Ryan,
I totally get the sensitivity.
I highlighted the section of our executed Master Service Agreement that covers certifications and liability. It is section (j) at the bottom of page 5. Also note, supporting EMV is the law around the world and eliminating the liability shift that merchants currently enjoy in the US if they can't take chip cards.
Please try and prioritize this as thousands of merchants, most of them hotels, are counting on it.
Thanks</p>

[2/7/17, 2:52:46 PM] Jared Isaacman: Any word?
[2/7/17, 2:52:59 PM] Ryan Carr: Not yet.
[2/8/17, 9:56:48 AM] Ryan Carr: He's going to get me the contact info this morning.
[2/9/17, 6:33:09 PM] Ryan Carr: Randy told me the product manager for the debit routing piece is Sam Reynolds. Have you heard of him?
[2/9/17, 6:33:27 PM] Jared Isaacman: 1000x
[2/9/17, 6:33:33 PM] Jared Isaacman: One of our biggest supporters
[2/9/17, 6:33:38 PM] Jared Isaacman: Ever
[2/9/17, 6:33:42 PM] Ryan Carr: Great.
[2/9/17, 6:33:49 PM] Ryan Carr: He's going to put us in touch.
[2/9/17, 6:33:53 PM] Jared Isaacman: Amazing
[2/9/17, 6:34:02 PM] Jared Isaacman: What changed
[2/9/17, 6:34:08 PM] Ryan Carr: He said the product manager was FD Canada.
[2/9/17, 6:34:17 PM] Ryan Carr: Which didn't make sense to either of us.
[2/9/17, 6:34:25 PM] Ryan Carr: I asked him to double check.
[2/9/17, 6:34:41 PM] Ryan Carr: And he did and got back to me a couple of hours or an hour ago.
[2/9/17, 6:34:44 PM] Jared Isaacman: Wow
[2/9/17, 6:34:49 PM] Jared Isaacman: That is awesome.
[2/9/17, 6:35:08 PM] Jared Isaacman: So many war stories I can share with you about Sam.
[2/9/17, 6:35:12 PM] Jared Isaacman: He is the best
[2/9/17, 6:35:19 PM] Ryan Carr: Great !!
[2/13/17, 9:17:33 PM] Jared Isaacman: Did we connect with Sam yet
[2/13/17, 9:49:22 PM] Ryan Carr: Yes I'm using Randy as a reference.
[2/13/17, 9:49:26 PM] Ryan Carr: Spoke to Amy.
[2/13/17, 9:49:40 PM] Jared Isaacman: Ok good
[2/13/17, 9:50:16 PM] Ryan Carr: I didn't want to call over her since you know him.
[2/13/17, 9:50:31 PM] Ryan Carr: But it might be quicker if you just call him directly.
[2/13/17, 9:50:44 PM] Jared Isaacman: Ok
[2/13/17, 9:51:21 PM] Jared Isaacman: I don't have a number for him
[2/13/17, 9:51:27 PM] Jared Isaacman: Do you?
[2/13/17, 9:56:02 PM] Ryan Carr: Yes. I'll find it in my notes and text you.
[2/13/17, 9:56:10 PM] Ryan Carr: One sec...
[2/13/17, 10:05:20 PM] Ryan Carr: Sorry, I don't seem to have it.
[2/13/17, 10:05:27 PM] Ryan Carr: Can you check with Kyle?
[2/13/17, 10:07:25 PM] Jared Isaacman: Yup
[2/14/17, 4:23:47 PM] Jared Isaacman: Any luck 1?
[2/14/17, 6:37:49 PM] Ryan Carr: Funny you should ask...
[2/14/17, 6:37:56 PM] Ryan Carr: Spoke to him a little while ago.
[2/14/17, 6:37:59 PM] Jared Isaacman: And???
[2/14/17, 6:38:13 PM] Ryan Carr: Waiting for 5:30 ET to roll around.
[2/14/17, 6:38:22 PM] Ryan Carr: He said that would be a good time to cal him back.
[2/14/17, 6:38:46 PM] Jared Isaacman: You mean 2:30 pacific?
[2/14/17, 6:39:05 PM] Ryan Carr: Whatever time it is in Atlanta.
[2/14/17, 6:40:13 PM] Jared Isaacman: You got this?
[2/14/17, 6:40:31 PM] Jared Isaacman: Or should I text him to make sure he takes call -Ike you are calling from a different number
[2/14/17, 6:40:37 PM] Ryan Carr: He told me specifically to call him at 5:30.
[2/14/17, 6:40:46 PM] Ryan Carr: He have me his cell. I got this.
[2/14/17, 6:40:50 PM] Jared Isaacman: Amazing
[2/14/17, 6:40:54 PM] Ryan Carr: Gave*
[2/14/17, 6:48:35 PM] Jared Isaacman: Let me know
[2/14/17, 10:40:14 PM] Jared Isaacman: How did the call go
[2/14/17, 10:42:43 PM] Ryan Carr: Went well. Waiting for a follow up call from them. I sent over our letter to him that they sent to us when we did our original debit certification via email to him.
[2/14/17, 10:43:04 PM] Ryan Carr: Asked him to mark it up and counter or send us new requirements in order to get the routing whitelisted.
[2/14/17, 10:43:10 PM] Ryan Carr: He understood.
[2/14/17, 10:43:23 PM] Jared Isaacman: So you did discuss the letter I sent over
[2/14/17, 10:43:41 PM] Ryan Carr: Yes. He said he needed to run it by some folks over there, legal and compliance.
[2/14/17, 10:43:51 PM] Ryan Carr: And he'd follow up with me.
[2/14/17, 10:44:01 PM] Jared Isaacman: Great.
[2/15/17, 9:35:01 AM] Jared Isaacman: Have you heard anything
[2/15/17, 10:44:40 AM] Ryan Carr: He called a little while ago. Said he had one call to make, then he would call me with an answer.
[2/15/17, 12:37:38 PM] Jared Isaacman: Any word
[2/15/17, 12:37:47 PM] Jared Isaacman: I feel Like we are days away from resolution
[2/15/17, 12:37:51 PM] Jared Isaacman: One way or another
[2/15/17, 12:48:38 PM] Ryan Carr: I agree. Waiting for the call.
[2/15/17, 2:38:40 PM] Jared Isaacman: Anything ?
[2/15/17, 3:41:57 PM] Ryan Carr: I called him. He's going to get back to me in about 20 minutes.
[2/15/17, 3:42:08 PM] Ryan Carr: But it's a no-go.
[2/15/17, 3:42:17 PM] Ryan Carr: He said we can only route how they want us to route.
[2/15/17, 3:42:33 PM] Jared Isaacman: ok. well that's the answer then.
[2/15/17, 3:42:45 PM] Ryan Carr: Agreed.
[2/15/17, 3:43:03 PM] Jared Isaacman: That simple.
[2/15/17, 3:43:17 PM] Jared Isaacman: So the question is do we have a message to deliver now
[2/15/17, 3:43:20 PM] Jared Isaacman: To their customers
[2/15/17, 3:43:20 PM] Ryan Carr: He asked if he could call you and explain it to you.
[2/15/17, 3:43:30 PM] Jared Isaacman: Yes. Absolutely.
[2/15/17, 3:43:48 PM] Jared Isaacman: I will make sure it's clear he tried his best
[2/15/17, 3:44:01 PM] Ryan Carr: Ok.
[2/15/17, 3:44:11 PM] Ryan Carr: I'll text him and let him know.
[2/15/17, 3:44:48 PM] Jared Isaacman: Please do
[2/16/17, 7:06:51 PM] Jared Isaacman: Did Sam ever call you back with the explanation
[2/16/17, 7:54:32 PM] Ryan Carr: No he didn't. I can call him tomorrow.
[2/16/17, 7:54:45 PM] Jared Isaacman: Ok
[2/22/17, 4:05:04 PM] Jared Isaacman: I've tried calling Ryan Kerr a few times for names of people at fd to speak with. Can you call him.
[2/22/17, 4:08:25 PM] Jared Isaacman: I can't understand why they can't answer
[2/22/17, 4:08:25 PM] Jared Isaacman: Can you also call the person you tried calling with Justin. The cfo
[2/22/17, 7:22:02 PM] Ryan Carr: I haven't been able to get Ryan on the phone, but Justin called me back and I gave him that guy's number.

<pre><code>[3/14/17, 9:55:12 PM] Jared Isaacman: Nice job
[3/14/17, 9:55:29 PM] Jared Isaacman: I did hear they were putting a pr hold in effect
[3/14/17, 9:55:42 PM] Jared Isaacman: So they probably throwing shit at wall to see what sticks
[3/14/17, 9:55:43 PM] Ryan Carr: We'll see.
[3/14/17, 9:55:59 PM] Jared Isaacman: If anything comes up. I'm here
[3/14/17, 9:56:06 PM] Ryan Carr: Okay great 👍
[3/14/17, 9:56:21 PM] Jared Isaacman: And all clear to call me at any time
[3/14/17, 10:33:24 PM] Jared Isaacman: I will say. It's very valuable to isolate all their communications.
[3/14/17, 10:33:57 PM] Jared Isaacman: That limits ability to control narrative
[3/14/17, 10:34:13 PM] Jared Isaacman: It's also completely transparent
[3/14/17, 10:38:18 PM] Ryan Carr: Yep.
[3/15/17, 9:02:59 AM] Ryan Carr: I have a call in to the PR contact. I'm researching now to see what the rules are for financial institutions in releasing information on their customers.
[3/15/17, 9:05:41 AM] Jared Isaacman: I would imagine there has to be something to prevent you from calling all customers of a bank and saying we don't think their product is any good.
[3/15/17, 9:07:39 AM] Ryan Carr: I agree. I wouldn't be researching this if I wasn't confident it was wrong.
[3/15/17, 9:08:41 AM] Jared Isaacman: I can't imagine investor relations would be pleased with their plan to wage pr war against their largest customer
[3/15/17, 9:08:53 AM] Jared Isaacman: Or customer of their largest customer
[3/15/17, 9:09:00 AM] Jared Isaacman: Depending how you define shift4
[3/15/17, 9:14:39 AM] Jared Isaacman: I also bet this would fall under fd obligation to protect their &quot;end user&quot; which is our merchant customers
[3/15/17, 9:53:29 AM] Ryan Carr: Preliminary research: they are required to &quot;protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such (customer) information&quot; https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/5000-4500.html#fdic5000part364.105app.b
[3/15/17, 9:54:29 AM] Jared Isaacman: Good
[3/15/17, 9:55:13 AM] Jared Isaacman: That would include protecting customer from being misled, confused ...
[3/15/17, 9:59:05 AM] Ryan Carr: It's going to be tough to find a PR firm that's willing to throw those rules out the window. Plus they are telling their customers that they should switch processors from CardConnect to First Data. If that's not disparagement, I don't know what is.
[3/15/17, 9:59:46 AM] Jared Isaacman: Yup.
[3/15/17, 10:01:28 AM] Jared Isaacman: Can we put any pressure on their pr firm?
[3/15/17, 10:01:48 AM] Jared Isaacman: Can we tell fd that we are going to talk to them
[3/15/17, 10:02:09 AM] Jared Isaacman: If they don't give commitment on pr by day end
[3/15/17, 10:07:14 AM] Ryan Carr: Yes. I'll call Ryan Kerr and tell him that after I speak to their PR firm.
[3/15/17, 10:07:47 AM] Jared Isaacman: You think that's a better approach then saying we are calling
[3/15/17, 10:07:54 AM] Jared Isaacman: At 3pm eastern regardless
[3/15/17, 10:07:59 AM] Jared Isaacman: To discuss
[3/15/17, 10:08:13 AM] Ryan Carr: That might be better.
[3/15/17, 10:08:25 PM] Jared Isaacman: Because you will be more prepared having talked to pr team beforehand. But pr firm isn't going to give you anything anyway
[3/15/17, 10:08:57 AM] Ryan Carr: Yeah I was thinking they wouldn't say much
[3/15/17, 10:09:16 AM] Jared Isaacman: Why don't we try to find a partner at the firm
[3/15/17, 10:09:29 AM] Jared Isaacman: And send same message
[3/15/17, 10:09:41 AM] Jared Isaacman: Get on their radar a bit
[3/15/17, 10:10:04 AM] Ryan Carr: Okay sounds good.
[3/15/17, 10:17:30 AM] Jared Isaacman: So the clock is ticking for fd. We are talking to their pr firm at 3pm eastern today
[3/15/17, 10:17:33 AM] Jared Isaacman: No matter what
[3/15/17, 10:31:41 AM] Jared Isaacman: Any ideas on pr firm partner
[3/15/17, 10:38:55 AM] Ryan Carr: looks like it could be a guy named Chris Harihar.
[3/15/17, 10:39:11 AM] Ryan Carr: Haven't been able to confirm it, but I think it's him.
[3/15/17, 10:39:14 AM] Ryan Carr: I can dig around.
[3/15/17, 10:39:19 AM] Jared Isaacman: Linkedin
[3/15/17, 10:39:24 AM] Ryan Carr: Yep.
[3/15/17, 10:41:09 AM] Ryan Carr: It's him https://www.linkedin.com/in/charihar
[3/15/17, 10:42:01 AM] Jared Isaacman: Perfect
[3/15/17, 10:43:22 AM] Jared Isaacman: &quot;Partner, Crenshaw communications&quot; I'd skip talking to pr team. Just reach right out and let them know we expect a call back
[3/15/17, 10:51:19 AM] Ryan Carr: Got it.
[3/15/17, 10:56:28 AM] Jared Isaacman: Did you email?
[3/15/17, 10:57:51 AM] Ryan Carr: Calling now. It let me leave him a VM for him.
[3/15/17, 10:57:55 AM] Ryan Carr: I'll email now too.
[3/15/17, 11:38:26 AM] Jared Isaacman: Good
[3/15/17, 12:52:19 PM] Jared Isaacman: Any word
[3/15/17, 12:59:39 PM] Ryan Carr: Nope. Just sent a follow up email to him.
[3/15/17, 1:00:43 PM] Jared Isaacman: Ok.
[3/15/17, 1:00:48 PM] Jared Isaacman: Did you ring kerr?
[3/15/17, 1:00:58 PM] Ryan Carr: Not yet. I wanted to give their PR guy two hours since the message this morning.
[3/15/17, 1:01:21 PM] Jared Isaacman: How about now. 3 eastern
[3/15/17, 1:01:54 PM] Ryan Carr: I can call now if you haven't already called the PR agency.
[3/15/17, 1:02:13 PM] Jared Isaacman: Call.
[3/15/17, 2:11:26 PM] Jared Isaacman: Any word?
[3/15/17, 2:14:51 PM] Ryan Carr: No to both.
[3/15/17, 2:14:59 PM] Ryan Carr: Left VMs for both.
[3/15/17, 2:16:27 PM] Jared Isaacman: So two choices
[3/15/17, 2:16:37 PM] Jared Isaacman: Do we want to send email from legal
[3/15/17, 2:16:44 PM] Jared Isaacman: Or pr team
[3/15/17, 2:18:01 PM] Ryan Carr: I was talking to Mike about this. He had a good approach. Email legal at First Data.
[3/15/17, 2:18:28 PM] Jared Isaacman: Ok let's do it
[3/15/17, 2:19:33 PM] Ryan Carr: If you don't mind drafting it, I can send it to Mike for his review before I send it
[3/15/17, 2:19:37 PM] Ryan Carr: up.*.
[3/15/17, 2:19:42 PM] Jared Isaacman: I have a better one
[3/15/17, 2:19:48 PM] Jared Isaacman: I'm going to call Taylor
[3/15/17, 2:19:56 PM] Jared Isaacman: And give one last shot to help
[3/15/17, 2:20:08 PM] Jared Isaacman: Then I have to loop in card connect team
[3/15/17, 2:20:21 PM] Ryan Carr: Okay.
[3/15/17, 3:42:47 PM] Jared Isaacman: Any word
[3/15/17, 4:07:23 PM] Ryan Carr: Nope.
[3/15/17, 7:36:35 PM] Ryan Carr: You get Taylor?
[3/15/17, 8:39:08 PM] Jared Isaacman: No.
[3/16/17, 7:42:53 AM] Jared Isaacman: Any luck today
[3/16/17, 10:06:14 AM] Ryan Carr: No. I spoke to an attorney friend and we drafted up a letter for me to send to the general counsel.
[3/16/17, 10:06:51 AM] Ryan Carr: It's a more formal request that they don't release a press statement.
[3/16/17, 10:06:55 AM] Jared Isaacman: Great
[3/16/17, 10:07:08 AM] Jared Isaacman: Can I see it first?
[3/16/17, 10:07:21 AM] Ryan Carr: Absolutely:

[3/16/17, 11:45:43 AM] Jared Isaacman: Can you please reach out to pr firm again while I review
[3/16/17, 11:46:49 AM] Ryan Carr: Sure. Do you want me to call
[3/16/17, 11:47:44 AM] Jared Isaacman: Email
[3/16/17, 11:47:49 AM] Jared Isaacman: And ask to speak with him today
[3/16/17, 11:48:09 AM] Ryan Carr: Will do.
[3/16/17, 11:48:46 AM] Jared Isaacman: Can then call 10 mins after to emphasize how serious
[3/16/17, 11:51:54 AM] Ryan Carr: Sounds good.
[3/16/17, 12:11:09 PM] Ryan Carr: Email sent to the PR guy. Calling now.
[3/16/17, 12:11:18 PM] Ryan Carr: *him
[3/16/17, 12:17:15 PM] Ryan Carr: Got his VM again.
