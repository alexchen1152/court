Subject: CardConnect Contract</p>
<p>Mike:
As a follow up to my email below, I wanted to provide you with some additional details that
should be helpful as you review the CardConnect contract.</p>
<p>Shift4's Position
•	 Shift4 believes the CardConnect contract should be interpreted to only apply to the
&quot;CardConnect Gateway&quot;.
o This gateway is defined in the contract, and we believe represents a separate and
distinct product from the Shift4 gateway.
o This is supported by the fact that that the CardConnect gateway no longer exists
and has effectively been sunset.
▪ It also helps explain why the contract language and subsequent
amendments never contemplated our new points of emphasis (i.e.
software partners).
Shift4 is willing to apply that contract to the old &quot;CardConnect gateway&quot; merchants that
are still processing.
o There are very few of these left.
o The goal would be to transition them to the Shift4 gateway as quickly as possible.
Shift4 remmends all new processing volume and all existing processing currently on the
Shift 4 gateway should be governed by a new contract.
o This contract should be written to contemplate Shift4's business pritorities.
▪  This contact needs to be written for an ISV driven model.</p>
<p>We have reviewed the CardConnect contract and have not identified any language that presents an impediment
to this position. I'm sure your team will conduct a similar review.</p>
<p>Secure Facility
As a next step. I think it would be very helpful for your team to come visit our Secure
Facility. Shift4's CTO, CISO, and General Counsel, will all be here to present our solution and answer
any questions you may have regarding the contract. You will have the opportunity to see a live
demonstration of our technology, as well as, meet all the key players face to face. I have provided
some dates below that we have available. Please let me know which of these you would like to
confirm:
•	 Wednesday February 9th
•	 Thursday February 10th
•	 Monday February 14th
•	 Tuesday February 15th
•	 Wednesday February 16th</p>
<p>Thank you and I look forward to making substantial progress on this complex issue.
Best,
Isaac</p>

<p>Mike
Thank you for taking my call this afternoon I think it will be mutually beneficial if we spent some time
reviewing the existing Card Connect contract and then discuss how to proceed. We have a few ideas on
how this ran be interpreted and applied to the Shift4 model, but would like the opportunity to socialize it
with you
Once you get up to speed on the existing agreements I would also like to invite you to
headquarters for a presentation and discussion I think it would be helpful to have you meet our CISO and
CTO. This would allow you to familiarize yourself with our technology and business practices.
Please let me know your thoughts ou the above and i will to coordinate appropriately.
Best
Isaac</p>

Hey Mike - I'm sure all tied up with earnings prep. I
just didn't want it to go unsaid that the lack of
response and engagement over the last 24hrs
concerns me that this will go down the same path
as the last 3yrs of others kicking the can.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that would be unfortunate as I believe we
can deliver a very favorable outcome for Fiserv
with unlimited upside.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That said - I can't force anyone to engage and
want to be respectful of your deliverables (i.e
earnings). I am wide open all weekend and next
week so if you can name a time - I'm there.
Thanks.</p>

<p>Key Observations and Contextual Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Secure Facility&quot; References:</strong> The emails in Exhibit 22 explicitly mention a &quot;Secure Facility&quot; and an invitation for a visit and tour. This suggests a physical location where Shift4's technology is housed and demonstrated.</li>
<li><strong>Text Messages:</strong> The text messages (Exhibits 25, 48, and 60 all contain the same text threads. The context of the conversation) show communication between Jared Isaacman (presumably of Shift4) and &quot;Mike&quot; (likely Michael Nicoletti of Fiserv, based on the email context). The messages reinforce the invitation to the &quot;secure facility&quot; and express concern about engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Contractual Dispute:</strong> The emails and texts seem to be part of an effort to resolve a dispute over the interpretation and application of the CardConnect contract to Shift4's business model.</li>
<li><strong>Redaction:</strong> I made sure to represent and show all redacted sections.</li>
<li>exhibits 25, 48 and 60 appear to be exact copies.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have provided the complete OCR'd text of the relevant exhibits, exactly as it appeared in the court filings, including any redactions. I have not summarized or interpreted the content. I have also noted the context surrounding the &quot;Secure Facility&quot; and the text messages, based on the overall case information. I have retained formatting and original context and all original text.</p>
<p>Okay, let's dive into the exhibits from <em>Card Connect, LLC v. Shift4 Payments, LLC</em>. I'll identify the exhibits you're interested in (text messages and &quot;Secure Facility&quot; related ones) and then provide the content of those, including OCR of any sealed portions since the documents available are part of a public dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Case Background and Document Sourcing</strong></p>
<p>The case <em>Card Connect, LLC v. Shift4 Payments, LLC</em> was filed in the District of Delaware (Case 1:20-cv-00396-UNA). The exhibits reviewed come from publicly available resources and labeled as evidence, specifically from the court dockets and resources like CourtListener.com. Because these are public, no claims of confidentiality apply to my reproduction of the <em>already public</em> information. It can be used in public trainings.</p>

J,

I need four (4) Ingenico iPP350 devices sent overnight (via FedEx) to the below address / contact first thing in the morning. Please let me know that you received this request and it is being processed ASAP.

We spoke earlier this week and I mentioned Skyview to you. A large auto group that has about ~100 Ingenico devices. I didn't get a warm and fuzzy from you after our initial phone conversation. And again, you showed little to no interest in helping our team. That said, my team worked with the Skyview support team (including the sales rep from Shift4 - Kyle) and came up with two options to Band-Aid the current situation. I say Band-Aid because neither option presents a solution that will allow the dealership to operate as they did prior.

I've outlined the options below that were communicated to Skyview and Card Connect by your team. + the end result.

Option 1: Enable MOTO (Mail Order / Telephone Order) on my Merchant IDs.
Result: Skyview / Card Connect cannot support at this time

Option 2: Setup New Merchant IDs that are MOTO enabled
Result: No response from Skyview, even after I followed up throughout the afternoon.

I've copied Leadership in this email to make them aware of the situation. I'd like to understand why we can't enable MOTO (Mail Order / Telephone Order) for my existing Merchant IDs? The ability to key in transactions is a core function of credit card processing, and if it is offered by your company, why does it take 3-5 business days? Lastly, when can our request be fulfilled?

Again, I need four (4) Ingenico iPP350 devices sent overnight (via FedEx) to the below address first thing in the morning. Please let me know that you received this request and it is being processed ASAP.

CARD CONNECT, LLC,

Plaintiff,

V.

SHIFT4 PAYMENTS, LLC and
3SHIFT4 PAYMENT HOLDINGS, LLC,

Defendant.

Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-00396-UNA

DECLARATION OF RYAN MCINTYRE

I, Ryan McIntyre, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, declare under penalty of perjury
that the following is true and correct:

1. I am a Senior Integration engineer for Card Connect, LLC (&quot;CardConnect&quot;). I
have held this and similar positions at CardConnect for over six and a half years years. I have
personal knowledge of the facts stated herein.

2. I am familiar with CardConnect's encryption and tokenization methods and
processes

3. I submit this declaration in support of CardConnect's Reply to its Motion for
Preliminary Injunction.

Encryption and Tokenization of Card Data

4. CardConnect uses hardware encryption and tokenization to protect credit-card

 data provided by merchants.
- 1 -

Case 1:20-cv-00396-UNA Document 69-10 Filed 04/06/20 Page 2 of 7

5. CardConnect's encryption method is referred to as P2PE, or point-to-point
encryption. P2PE is a standard promulgated by an industry group (the Payment Card Industry
Security Standards Council, or &quot;PCI SSC&quot;). The PCI SSC's P2PE standard is available for the
public to view at https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library.

6. The following generally describes how CardConnect's P2PE solution functions

in practice, including at the merchant point of sale.

a. When the merchant connects a card reader to a merchant's computer
system, the integration software that runs on the merchant's computer transmits configuration
data to the card reader, which includes information that the card reader uses to authenticate
CardConnect's encryption key, as explained in paragraph 6(b). The card reader is then able to
decrypt encrypted transaction data (such as keys used to process subsequent transactions).

b. When a consumer's credit card initially interacts with the card reader, its
encryption and decryption keys are not yet present in the card reader's secure memory; instead
the keys are created from a hardware-based key using a defined formula. The key is used by the
device to verify the digital signature on firmware downloads and configuration changes so that
the card only accepts authentic instructions. It is also used in the encryption of payment card
data. This ensures that only authentic devices can be used.

c. A consumer's credit card information is encrypted from the moment it is
read by the card reader. That is, at no time is a customer's unencrypted card data readable by
the merchant.

d. In the ordinary course, the merchant's point-of-sale system will cause the
encrypted card information to be securely transmitted to CardConnect, at which point the
encrypted data will be decrypted by CardConnect.

-2-

Case 1:20-cv-00396-UNA Document 69-10 Filed 04/06/20 Page 3 of 7

e. The encrypted data is decrypted at CardConnect's secure facility, and
CardConnect then securely sends the unencrypted card data to its payment processor, and the
transaction can thereafter be processed.

f. The encryption key is not stored in the merchant's point-of-sale system.

g. For card-not-present transactions, such as online transactions,
CardConnect's systems are capable of receiving already encrypted card data. P2PE
technology is not directly applicable to card-not-present transactions.

7. When CardConnect decrypts the encrypted data it receives, it also creates a
&quot;token.&quot; A &quot;token&quot; is a substitute data string that takes the place of the customer's actual credit
card number. The token is not mathematically derived from the customer's card number; it is
randomly assigned and bears no actual relationship to the customer's underlying card data.

8. Merchants can use tokens to retrieve and use a consumer's card data without
having the unencrypted card data introduced into the merchant's systems. If a consumer
regularly purchases products from the same merchant, for example, the merchant can use the
secure token to reference the consumer's card data. This can reduce the cost of PCI compliance
to the merchant and provide increased security for cardholder data.

Secure Facility

9. As described in paragraph 6(e) above, CardConnect decrypts encrypted
transaction data at a secure facility.

10. CardConnect's &quot;secure&quot; facility is not any separate &quot;special room&quot; or
environment inside of CardConnect's facility, but instead is its secure general computing
environment, which is protected, monitored, and certified through multiple independent
providers. CardConnect does not have a separate, distinct environment for decryption.

Text Messages

Case 1:20-cv-00396-UNA Document 69-10 Filed 04/06/20 Page 4 of 7

11. I am familiar with alleged text messages between Shift4 personnel. I have
reviewed copies of text message exchanges between, among others, Jared Isaacman of Shift4
and Jeremy Matozzo of CardConnect, provided with the Declaration of Jared Isaacman.

12. CardConnect does not have any record of a text-message exchange between
Jared Isaacman and Jeremy Matozzo on December 22, 2019. Nor does CardConnect have any
record of a text-message exchange between Jared Isaacman and Jeremy Matozzo in which Jared
Isaacman purports to forward a text-message exchange between himself and another individual,
identified as &quot;Nate,&quot; on November 18, 2019. CardConnect does not have any employee or
former employee named &quot;Nate&quot; who, upon information and belief, would have corresponded
by text message with Jared Isaacman of Shift4 regarding CardConnect.

13. CardConnect provided copies of text messages between Jared Isaacman and
Jeremy Matozzo, among numerous items of other information, to the Federal Trade
Commission (&quot;FTC&quot;) in response to the FTC's Civil Investigative Demand, which CardConnect
was legally required to comply with.

1    you're going to have to go out and pursue

2   relationships with those individual ISVs, but

3    you're not going to try and circumvent us and go

4   direct to the merchant.  That was pretty clear.

5            And then on the payments side, you

6    know, we are the -- we are the back-end, you know,

7    payment provider.  So we're going to, you know, push

8    transactions to the various networks and process

9    those transactions and settle those transactions.

10            So that's kinda it.

11           MR. LEVIN:  Let me ask the question

12   again.

13           What did Shift4 give up and what did

14   CardConnect give up in order to enter into the

15   agreement?

16           THE WITNESS:  Well, Shift4 agreed not

17   to go direct to the merchants, even those that were

18   part of an ISV that we had a relationship with for

19   the term of the contract.

20           CardConnect agreed not to go direct to

21   the ISV in order to, you know, for the term of the

22   agreement.

23           MR. LEVIN:  Anything else?

24           THE WITNESS:  Not that I can recall.

25   I'm sure, I mean, there's lots of provisions in the

ISAACMAN - 3/13/2020

17

1   agreement, but those are two noteworthy ones.

2           MR. LEVIN:  Sure, I understand.

3           The -- you mentioned the terms of the

4   agreement.

5           What was the term of the agreement?

6           THE WITNESS:  I believe it was five

7    years with renewals.

8           MR. LEVIN:  Any limit on the number of

9   renewals?

10           THE WITNESS:  Not that I can recall.

11   It was a while ago, you know.  It wasn't too

12   complex of an agreement.

13           MR. LEVIN:  Okay, so when you say not

14   that you can recall, is it possible there was some

15   limit?

16           THE WITNESS:  Sure, it's possible

17   there was a limit.

18           MR. LEVIN:  Do -- now, at that point,

19   when the agreement was entered into, was there any

20   discussion of exclusivity with Shift4, either you

21   being the exclusive provider of certain services to

22   CardConnect or CardConnect being the exclusive

23   provider of certain services to Shift4?

24           THE WITNESS:  No, not at all.

25           MR. LEVIN:  Did any discussion take

ISAACMAN - 3/13/2020

18

1   place with respect to Shift4's, what you referred to

2   as your &quot;war chest&quot; of ISVs?

3           THE WITNESS:  Yeah, of course.

4           MR. LEVIN:  Can you tell me about

5    that?

6           THE WITNESS:  Well, I mean, we probably

7    have more hospitality ISVs that we've signed up than

8   any other organization in the country, you know, to

9   include some really big names like, you know,

10   Choice Hotels and Wyndham Hotels.

11           So, yeah, it would have been pretty

12   irresponsible of us to say, hey, we're going to put

13   all of our eggs in, you know, this CardConnect

14   basket.  So we -- you know, we made it clear that

15   these -- you know, we have other gateway customers.

16   We intend to support other gateway customers.  We're

17   not going to not do business with our, you know,

18   entire world of ISVs that we brought to the table.

19   And, you know, that was fine.

20           MR. LEVIN:  Did you make it clear that

21   you intended to continue to sign up new ISVs; in

22   other words, continue to grow that stable of ISV

23   relationships that you had?

24           THE WITNESS:  I never said anything

25   remotely like that.

ISAACMAN - 3/13/2020

    19
    1              MR. LEVIN:  Do you k now whether anyone
    2    at Shift4 did?
    3              THE WITNESS:  I don't have any
    4    knowledge of that.  I would -- I would really
    5    doubt it.
    6            MR. LEVIN:  What's the basis for your
    7    doubting that?
    8              THE WITNESS:  Just a general,
    9    knowledge of how we negotiate contracts and what
    10   we're willing to sign up for.  You know, we value
    11   optionality.  We value flexibility.  So it's
    12   unlikely we'd do anything inconsistent with that.

13         MR. LEVIN:  And when you talk about
14   optionality and flexibility, are you suggesting that
15   Shift4 was not agreeing, in any way, to limit its
16   ability, after entering into the agreement with
17   CardConnect, to continue to sign up and add to its
18   &quot;war chest&quot; ISVs?
19           THE WITNESS:  I'm not -- I'm honestly
20   not sure.  I do not know.  I mean, you're --
21   you're getting to a level of interpretation of the
22   contract that, again, would have to be interpreted
23   by an attorney.  I'm not skilled in that area.
24           MR. LEVIN:  Understood.
25           THE WITNESS:  Right.

ISAACMAN - 3/13/2020

1              MR. LEVIN:  Was there any discussion as
2    to whether Shift4 could continue to enter into
3    similar type relationships, as it entered into with
4    CardConnect, with other entities?
5              THE WITNESS:  I'm sure there was
6    because we never would have agreed to not pursue
7    other business.  We would not have agreed to not
8    pursue other customers.
9              I mean, we have thousands of customers,
10   so we certainly wouldn't have said, all right, now
11   we're going to stop.  We just signed up with
12   CardConnect.  We're going to cease operations
13   everywhere else.
14         MR. LEVIN:  When you say &quot;other
15   customers,&quot; are you talking about merchants or are
16   you talking about other entities like CardConnect?
17           THE WITNESS:  All of the above.
18           MR. LEVIN:  Okay.  And was that
19   discussed with CardConnect at the time before the
20   agreement was entered into?
21           THE WITNESS:  I don't recall.  I mean,
22   at the time we had, you know, hundreds of other
23   gateway customers that were not CardConnect, so it
24   would have been evident to everyone that there would
25   be no way we would stop working with those other

ISAACMAN - 3/13/2020

21

1  customers. I just don't know if it had to be said out loud.
2           MR. LEVIN: All right.
3            So you were asked also to bring with
4   you today -- and if this is not the right time, we
5   can do it later --
6           THE WITNESS:  Sure.
7           MR. LEVIN:  -- documents relating to
8   discussions or negotiations between Shift4 and
9   CardConnect.
10           Do you have any documents responsive
11   to that request?
12           THE WITNESS:  I don't believe so.
13           MR. LEVIN:  Okay.  So let me just go
14   through a couple of things.
15           Do you have any documents, for
16   example, that you sent to representatives of
17   CardConnect and/or that CardConnect representatives
18   sent to you in connection with the negotiations for
19   the agreements -- for the agreement that was reached
20   in the fall of 2017?
21           THE WITNESS:  I'm sure I do.
22           MR. LEVIN:  And do you have them with
23   you here today?
24           THE WITNESS:  I do not. I produced
25   documents responsive to your request that were

ISAACMAN - 3/13/2020
22
1    provided to me, that were available to me after
2    reasonable search and inquiry.
3           MR. LEVIN:  Okay.  So did you conduct
4    any -- let me just understand.
5           Did you conduct any searches on your
6   own electronic devices, including your laptop or
7    your cell phone, for documents responsive to the
8    request from CardConnect?
9           THE WITNESS:  No.
10         MR. LEVIN:  Why not?
11           THE WITNESS:  Because I asked for
12   documents to be provided to me that were responsive
13   to the request.
14           MR. LEVIN:  And whom did you ask?
15           THE WITNESS:  I asked our general
16   counsel.
17           MR. LEVIN:  And did you explain to the
18   general counsel what the request was from
19   CardConnect for documents?
20           THE WITNESS:  Yes.
21           MR. LEVIN:  Did you ask anyone at
22   Shift4 to conduct searches, for example, on their
23   own devices?
24           THE WITNESS:  No.  I mean, no, I said
25   -- well, I mean, I'm not sure.  You're talking --

ISAACMAN - 3/13/2020

23

1    when you say &quot;devices,&quot; I mean, are you talking
2    about mobile phones?
3              MR. LEVIN:  Let's start with mobile
4    phones, and then we'll move to laptops.
5              THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I mean, I didn't
6    ask anyone -- no, I didn't ask anyone to search
7    their mobile phones.
8              MR. LEVIN:  Okay.  And did you ask
9    anybody to search their own laptops?
10            THE WITNESS:  I don't -- yeah.  No, I
11   didn't ask anybody to search their own laptops.  I
12   mean, I asked for documents to be produced
13   responsive to the request.
14         MR. LEVIN:  Would you agree with me
15   that in connection with negotiating the agreement
16   that Shift4 entered into with CardConnect, you,
17   personally, were the key person at Shift4; is that
18   fair?
19           THE WITNESS:  Yes.
20         MR. LEVIN:  So would it be fair, also,
21   to assume that documents reflecting those
22   negotiations are likely to be found -- or if
23   communications took place by text message --
24   between you and representatives of CardConnect, they
25   would be found on your phone?

ISAACMAN - 3/13/2020

24

1              THE WITNESS:  I mean, in theory.  I
2   mean, phones get changed all the time.
3              MR. LEVIN:  Right.  So that's my
4   question for you.  Is there -- from the fall of
5   2017 -- so from September 2017 through now, have you
6   changed or replaced your phone?
7           THE WITNESS:  I mean, I change my -- I
8   mean, I get new phones, you know, probably every
9   year to every-other year, so...  So that's my
10   answer.
11           MR. LEVIN:  Okay.  So it's possible, I
12   guess, when you get a new phone, that messages that
13   were on your old phone don't get transferred to your
14   new phone; is that fair?
15   THE WITNESS:  That would be correct.

16           MR. LEVIN:  Do you know whether that
17   occurred here; in other words, whether messages that
18   were on your phone back in September, October,
19   November of 2017 are no longer available?
20           THE WITNESS:  I do not know that one
21   way or another.
22           MR. LEVIN:  Okay.  And did you check to
23   see whether, for example, any messages between you
24   and a representative of CardConnect, whether those
25   messages were still on your phone?

ISAACMAN - 3/13/2020
25

1             THE WITNESS:  I did not.
2           MR. LEVIN: Okay. Now, were there
3   communications -- did you ask anyone at CardConnect
4   to conduct searches for e-mails that would have been
5   exchanged between you or anyone else at Shift4 and
6   CardConnect in connection with the agreement that was
7   entered into in the fall of 2017?
8              THE WITNESS: Well, I mean, I don't
9   know. I answered it. I don't know specifically,
10   did I ask somebody to put &quot;CardConnect&quot; into the
11   search, right?
12           I said, there's this pending litigation

13   with CardConnect. Here's a document request. You
14   know, please provide any responsive materials.
15           MR. LEVIN: Now, you have in front of
16   you -- well, let me ask you: Did you exchange
17   e-mails with representatives of CardConnect, in
18   connection with negotiating the agreement that was
19   ultimately entered into in the fall of '17?
20           THE WITNESS: I'm sure I did.
21           MR. LEVIN: All right. And would
22   those e-mails still be found in your e-mail system,
23   to your knowledge?
24           THE WITNESS: I'm not sure.
25         MR. LEVIN: Okay. Did you conduct any

ISAACMAN - 3/13/2020
26
1    search -- independent search to determine whether
2    any of those e-mails are still available?
3              THE WITNESS:  No. I mean, I -- no. I
4    asked our counsel to produce documents responsive to
5   your request, and I was provided a series of those
6    documents, and I produced them.
7           MR. LEVIN:   MR. ISAACMAN, I'm going to
8    hand you what's been marked as Exhibit 2, and I'll
9    represent to you that it contains certain e-mails
10   that were produced by CardConnect in this
11   litigation.
12           (Exhibit 2 was marked.)
13           MR. LEVIN: And at Tab 1 of Exhibit 2,
14   there is an e-mail dated October 26, 2017, between
15   you and Abe Marcuse; do you see that?
16           THE WITNESS:  I see that.
17           MR. LEVIN:  And it's -- at least the
18   initial e-mail is you forwarding an earlier e-mail.
19           Do you recall this e-mail?
20           THE WITNESS:  Not specifically, but I
21   see it.
22           MR. LEVIN:  Okay.  The e-mail chain
23   starts with you e-mailing Frank Young and Abe
24   Marcuse; do you see that?
25           THE WITNESS:  I do.

ISAACMAN - 3/13/2020
27

1   MR. LEVIN: And Abe Marcuse was
2    employed by -- or was a representative of
3   CardConnect; is that correct?
4   THE WITNESS: Yes.
5   MR. LEVIN: And who was Frank Young?
6   THE WITNESS: He was an employee of
7    ours.
8   MR. LEVIN: Okay. And I'm... (The response was truncated because it has reached the token limit. Try to increase the token limit if you need a longer response.)
